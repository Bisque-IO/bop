## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **BOP (Bisque Orchestration Platform)**, a high-performance, polyglot distributed systems platform. The project is designed for real-time messaging and consensus-driven applications, with a focus on efficiency and a layered architecture.

The core of the project is `libbop`, a low-level C library that provides fundamental features like:

*   **Raft Consensus:** Using `NuRaft`.
*   **High-Performance Networking:** Leveraging `uSockets` and `uWebSockets`.
*   **Durable Storage:** With `libmdbx` and `SQLite`.
*   **Efficient Memory Management:** Using `snmalloc`.
*   **Security:** TLS provided by `WolfSSL`.

On top of `libbop`, the `bopd` server is implemented in the Odin programming language. `bopd` acts as a server daemon that can be run standalone or embedded within other applications. It exposes the features of `libbop` and can host services written in other languages through runtimes like GraalVM, LuaJIT, and Wasmtime.

The repository also includes client libraries and components for other languages, such as Rust and Java/Kotlin (in the `jvm` directory), to interact with the BOP platform.

## Building and Running

The project uses a combination of build tools, including `xmake`, `bake`, and `cargo`.

### Odin (`bopd` server)

To build the `bopd` server, you need the Odin compiler.

```bash
# Build the server
odin build bopd -out:bopd

# Run the server
./bopd server --port 8080
```

### Rust (Safe wrappers and applications)

The Rust components can be built using `cargo`.

```bash
# Build the entire Rust workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

### General Build

The project seems to have a top-level build script using `bake`.

```bash
# (Assuming bake is set up)
bake
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Polyglot:** The project embraces multiple programming languages, each suited for its specific purpose (C for low-level, Odin for the server, Rust for safe wrappers, etc.).
*   **Layered Architecture:** The project is structured in layers, with `libbop` at the core, `bopd` as the server, and client libraries at the top.
*   **Binary Protocol:** BOP uses a custom binary protocol for efficient and fast communication between clients and the server.
*   **Modularity:** The monorepo is organized into modules for different components (`bopd`, `rust`, `jvm`, `lib`, etc.).
*   **Build System:** `xmake` and `bake` are used for building the C/C++ and Odin parts of the project. `cargo` is used for Rust.
