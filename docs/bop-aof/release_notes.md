# BOP AOF Release Notes (Draft)

This file aggregates milestone highlights prior to publishing in an official `CHANGELOG.md` once automation lands.

## 2025-09 (Milestones 1â€“3)
- Established stakeholder matrix, cadence, and tooling for documentation initiative.
- Delivered public documentation package (overview, getting started, API, CLI, operations) with approved templates and diagrams.
- Consolidated internal architecture suite (architecture, segment format, maintenance, testing, runbooks, roadmap) with SME sign-off.

## 2025-09 (Milestone 4 In Progress)
- Drafted user and developer manuals; added troubleshooting matrices, support policy, ownership checklist, and code example scaffolding.
