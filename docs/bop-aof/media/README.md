# bop-aof Media Assets

Store source diagrams (Draw.io, Excalidraw) and exported images referenced by the bop-aof documentation set.

- Keep editable sources (`.drawio`, `.excalidraw`, `.svg`) alongside rendered PNG/SVG outputs.
- Name assets with the document prefix, for example `overview-tier-pipeline.drawio`.
- Document usage in the related markdown file's changelog, and commit both source and export files together.

- Mermaid sources (`.mmd`) are encouraged for text-based diagrams; export SVG/PNG when publishing.
