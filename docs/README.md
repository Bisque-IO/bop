## Low-level Raft Core

In a distributed system driven by Raft consensus, the quality of the low-level
primitives—networking, storage, cryptography, and memory management—is not just
a performance consideration; it’s a foundation for determinism, security, and
correctness. Raft requires precise control over log replication, state transitions,
timeouts, and failure recovery. Any inconsistency in network I/O, storage writes,
or memory layout can introduce subtle race conditions, data corruption, or divergence
between cluster nodes. High-quality, battle-tested low-level primitives
(like uSockets for networking, libmdbx or direct I/O for durable storage, and WolfSSL
for cryptography) ensure every Raft operation behaves exactly the same, every time,
across all nodes—even under fault, stress, or adversarial conditions.

Moreover, these primitives directly impact the system’s ability to scale and respond
under load. Deterministic timing (e.g. through real-time-safe clocks or efficient
epoll/io_uring handling) is critical for maintaining heartbeat intervals and election
timeouts. Secure primitives guard against injection, MITM, and timing attacks, while
zero-copy memory and fsync-aligned persistence reduce latency for log writes and
snapshots. When Raft is at the heart of your architecture—as in your system—any
instability in the foundation ripples upward into service reliability. Investing in
robust, minimal, and predictable C-based primitives makes the entire stack—from consensus
to cluster coordination to application state—provably safer and operationally bulletproof.
